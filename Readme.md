### Status - Preview Release

_July 2 2025_ - **Seeking Feedback.** First version of the spec and Rust implimentation released

Next: **Finalize specification and start making PRs into Coding Agents**

## Why `git-ai`?

`git blame` attributes all code to the commit's author, even when much of it is AI-generated.

**⭐️Git-native** - enhanced authorship is stored in Git and linked to commit hashes.

**🫡Simple and explicit** - no file system monitors, keyloggers or batch-write hueristics. Supported Agents call `git-ai checkpoint --author "Claude Code " --model claude-4-sonnet` after

**🤞Emerging Standard** - developers have tool choice, and they're likely using a mix of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.

**⚡️Fast + Cross Platform** - implimented in Rust, as fast as `git status`, and built on [`libgit2`](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2)

## Quickstart

1. Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://gitai.run/install | bash
```

2. Init - adds a local precommit and postcommit hook

```
git-ai init
```

> If you are not using Claude Code, you'll need to manually mark AI contributions by running `git-ai checkpoint --author 'Cursor'` after approving generated code. Automatic support for Cursor, Codex, Copilot support coming soon!

3. Add hooks to Claude Code

```json file=".claude/settings.local.json"
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git-ai checkpoint"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git-ai checkpoint --author \"Claude Code\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

4. Just work and commit, like you already do! Claude Code will mark its contributions after writing to the file system and the precommit hooks will mark your contributions.

5. After your first join commit, run `git-ai blame path/to/file` to see which lines were written by the AI.

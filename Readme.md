### Status

_July 1 2025_ - **Seeking Feedback.** First version of the spec and Rust implimentation released

Next: **Finalize specification and push for adoption by Coding Agents**

## Why `git-ai`?

`git blame` attributes all code to the commit's author, even when much of it is AI-generated.

**‚≠êÔ∏èGit-native** - enhanced authorship is stored in Git and linked to commit hashes.

**ü´°Simple and explicit** - no file system monitors, keyloggers or batch-write hueristics. Supported Agents call `git-ai checkpoint --author claude-4-sonnet` after

**(ü§ûEmerging) Universal standard** - developers have tool choice, and they're likely using a mix of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.

**‚ö°Ô∏èFast + Cross Platform** - implimented in Rust, xms latency, and built on [`libgit2`](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2)

## Quick Start

---

## For Agent Builders (we need your help!)

- show example patch for Codex
- some psudo code

### The Standard

- only worry about the authorship attestation. MUST [format]
- MAY be generated by this CLI
- how you do incrimental tracking is your own concern, but it MUST case 1, case 2, case 3. Reference implimentation does this by saving working diffs between checkpoints in the git log
- Files MUST not be staged or added to Git unless explicitly done by the user using the regular commands
